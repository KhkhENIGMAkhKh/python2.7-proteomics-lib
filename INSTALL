Installing Proteomics python library
====================================

You can use Python's setuptools to install the Proteomics python
library: download the archive (either .tar.gz or .zip), unpack it and
then do:

    python setup.py install

in the unpacked directory.

Alternatively if you're using pip to manage your Python installations then you can do

    pip install proteomics-<version>.tar.gz

You can also use pip to install directly from github using

    pip install -e git+git://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/proteomics-python2.7-proteomics-lib

Any of these will make the `proteomics` library available for use in development.
